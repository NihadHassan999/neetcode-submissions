-> cover edge case that endword should be in wordlist
-> add beginword to list
-> iterate through every word and each character and get pattern
-> create hashmap based on patters
-> now create visit hashset and add current word to it, create q and res = 1
-> now while q, popleft and get neightbours as well too

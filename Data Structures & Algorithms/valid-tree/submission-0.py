'''
-> BFS, tree should have all components with edges and no cycles
-> To validate if a given graph is a valid tree, we need two conditions:
   1. The graph should be connected, meaning all nodes are reachable from any starting point.
   2. The graph should not contain any cycles.
   3. The number of edges should be exactly n - 1, where n is the number of nodes.

-> Approach:
   - Use BFS to traverse the graph and keep track of visited nodes.
   - Ensure there are no cycles by checking if we revisit any node that is not the immediate parent.
   - After traversal, check if all nodes are visited to ensure the graph is connected.

'''
Time Complexity : O(V + E)
- Each node and edge is visited at most once during the BFS traversal.

Space Complexity : O(V + E)
- The adjacency list representation takes O(V + E) space.
- The queue can contain up to O(V) nodes in the worst case.
